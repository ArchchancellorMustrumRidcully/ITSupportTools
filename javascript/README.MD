# Javascript Web Browser Scripts

## Why JavaScript?
JavaScript can run natively in Chromium based browsers and with Javascript you can do things that you can code in other languages such as Python.
Using JavaScript eliminates the barrier of having to learn how to use an API client. One of the things I've enjoyed learning is how GUIs authorise and authenticate requests to APIs which then bring you back data on a fancy HTML web page.
Another benefit of JavaScript is you can use your learning and apply that to other languages.

## Special thank you
Before I go any further I'd like to give a big shoutout to [Gabriel Sroka](https://github.com/gabrielsroka/) who you may know as developer of [Rockstar](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/rockstar/chjepkekmhealpjipcggnfepkkfeimbd) for Okta.
Gabriel has taught me some key things about JavaScript and helped refactor my 'midnight' code. Also you'll notice I reuse certain functions from Rockstar and from [okta_api](https://github.com/gabrielsroka/okta_api) as well
